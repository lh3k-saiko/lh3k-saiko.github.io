# About Me

## What does the name <code class="mx-1">lh3k</code> mean?

`lh3k` is the abbreviation of `localhost:3000`, an (maybe old-fashioned) address in front-end development.

It's preferred to pronounce it as "el ayche trikilo" rather than "el ayche three kay", since the latter might be mistakenly taken for `lhkkk`.

## What do you do?

- CS undergraduate of UESTC
- Nominal student coach of UESTC_XCPC (the CP training team of my school) during 2024-2025.
- Front-end developer out of interest
- ... 

## Is there any your contact info?

There are multiple official contact details of me, but at present there's only one I'd like to share here:

- <NOIZEBREAKSEQUENCE@126.com>

Additionally, my codeforces id is [lh3k](https://codeforces.com/profile/lh3k). But I do not check my codeforces account frequently. So I suggest to use the email above to contact me for any necessary communication.

## Is there any game you're playing now / Can I get on your friends list in XX game?

Aha, I've played a variety of games, but currently, it seems that it's only [*Rain World*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/312520) that I'm still playing.

Nonetheless, feel free to ask me to play XX game with you. Maybe I will be surprised and finger out that "Wow! I have played this game before."
